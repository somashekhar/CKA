# place the pod definition in /etc/kubernetes/manifests
# set this path in kubelet.service
# --pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests or 

# --config=kubeconfig.yaml in kubelet.service and then inside this file
# staticPodPath= /etc/kubernetes/manifests

# ps -ef | grep kubelet

# Use docker commands since there is no CLI utility
# docker ps 


# You can identify the static pods using node name. The pod names end by node name.
