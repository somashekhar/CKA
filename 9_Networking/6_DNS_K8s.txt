CoreDNS:
  It is deployed as a pod in kube-system namespace. It is used by default as a DNS service in k8s.

  cat /etc/coredns/Corefile

  kubectl get service -n kube-system 

When pods are created in k8s cluster, k8s takes care to configure nameserver(CoreDNS service running on kube-system) in them through kubelet.
Pods reach outside internet through this specific coredns service.

cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
cat /etc/resolv.conf

We can reach to service through specifying,(but for pods you need to give fqdn)
host web-service
